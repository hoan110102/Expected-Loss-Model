# Introduction
This is a project that focuses on building an expected loss model, a key component of risk management for financial institutions such as banks. By leveraging historical data and advanced statistical techniques, the model aims to estimate potential losses associated with loans. Such models will play an important role in assessing credit risk, setting appropriate reserves, and ensuring financial stability in uncertain economic conditions.

# Datasets
The [Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielsantello/wholesale-and-retail-orders-dataset) used in this project is taken from Kaggle.
